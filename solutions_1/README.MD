### Exercise 1

Given two floats `a` and `b`, and some tolerance `tol`, write an expression that will test whether `a` and `b` are within `tol` of each other.


### Exercise 2 

Assume you have some variable `elapsed` that contains elapsed time in seconds.
Create three new variables: `hours`, `minutes` and `seconds`, that represent the number of hours, minutes and seconds represented by `elapsed`.
For example, if `elapsed = 7835`, then `hours = 2`, `minutes = 10` and `seconds = 35`
