### Exercises

#### Exercise 1
Given a variable `a` (containing any value), re-assign the value `"N/A"` if `a` is `None`, and leave `a` unchanged otherwise. Use an `if...else...` statement.
#### Exercise 2
Do the same thing as Question 1, but this time use a ternary operator.
#### Exercise 3
Given an credit score `score`, assign a string value to another variable `rating` based on the following scale:

- [0, 580) --> Poor
- [580, 670) --> Fair
- [670, 740) --> Good
- [740, 800) --> Very Good
- [800, 850] --> Excellent

#### Exercise 4
Given an `elapsed` time (in seconds), write code to set a variable `magnitude` based on the following conditions:

- if elapsed time is less than 1 minute, `magnitude` --> `'seconds'`
- if elapsed time is more than 1 minute, but less than 1 hour, `magnitude` --> `'minutes'`
- if elapsed time is more than 1 hour, but less than 1 day, `magnitude` --> `'hours'`
- if elapsed time is more than 1 day, but less than 1 week: `magnitude` --> `'days'`
- if elapsed time is more than 1 week, `magnitude` --> '`weeks'`
